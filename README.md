> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# First you need to check your vue version by typing in vue --version. If there is no installed version of Vue then you must type into the terminal `npm install -g vue-cli`

After this step then you must bootstrap the project by typing `vue init webpack test-project` into the terminal. You can give the project a name and then select enter on the next two prompts. Select Read-only on the vue build prompt and then select no on all remaining prompts to successfully create your project skeleton.

Now you will have to install the Node modules so cd into the project folder name so type in `cd test-project` or whatever name you gave it into your terminal to change directories. After you have done this, type `npm install` and follow that with `npm run dev` to test the project. 

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
